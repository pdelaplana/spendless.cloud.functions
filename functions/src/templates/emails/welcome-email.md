## Email Body

Hey {firstName},

Thanks for signing up! I'm glad you're here.

You know that feeling when you check your bank account and wonder where all your money went? Yeah, we've all been there. That's why I built Spendless - to help you actually understand your spending without the guilt trip.

### Here's how to get rolling:

**Create a period** - Pick how you want to track your spending: weekly, monthly, or whatever works for you.

**Set up your wallets** - Create as many wallets as you need. Personal spending, groceries, business expenses - you name it. Set a spending limit for each one, and the app will help you stay on track.

**Start tracking** - Add your first expense. That coffee, lunch, or whatever you just bought. Takes like 10 seconds. You'll see how much of your limit is left.

### A few things you might like:

- Works offline - track expenses anywhere, sync when you're back online
- Your currency - track in USD, EUR, BRL, or whatever currency you use (more currencies coming soon)
- Customized tags - organize expenses your way with personalized categories
- Mood tracking - optional, but eye-opening (ever notice how emotions affect spending?)
- Privacy first - no ads, no selling your data, ever

There's no "right way" to use Spendless. Some people track everything, others just the big stuff. Do what works for you.

One more thing - Spendless is actively being developed and improved. Your feedback shapes what gets built next. Found a bug? Have an idea? Want something to work differently? Just send me an email. I actually read these and they matter.

Cheers,
{founderName}
Founder, Spendless

P.S. - Start simple. You can always add more detail later.
